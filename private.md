# TODO
- see what github actions I could use for automatic postgres actions
  - can perform `pg_dump -h host -U user -t 'public."Location"' -t 'public."Comment"' --column-inserts --data-only --no-owner --no-privileges postgres | grep '^INSERT' > backup.sql` to dump public data
- mobile cant handle resize events for its menubar
- separate out existing and non-existing locations
- FIX TIME ESTIMATE!!! `x/sinh(arctanh(.95))` you can't just multiply a ly by 1.05 and call it a day
